# Data

Files within this directory are `raw` .json and .csv files we want to use to seed our vectors and database. 


## How it works

We scrape Twitter for each user profile to extract their likes, tweets, retweets and replies. An easy to execute this is to leverage actors in `https://console.apify.com/actors/` although it has certain limits, we can augment our with other external sources. 


However API-FY is the a more automated workflow compared to the other sources where we reverse engineer the twitter mobile apps or web apps to load these information.
