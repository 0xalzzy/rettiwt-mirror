When Elon took over, the twitter ads revenue took a nosedive as advertisers started pulling out, and companies had issues with certain terms, plus he failed in his bragging to fix bot accounts asap. 

To fix this, Elon made two terrible mistakes.   

1.  By assuming because people tweet “This app shouldn’t be free” every time, that all of us will be willing to pay a monthly subscription.   The goal of this was the bump of MRR ( Monthly Recurring Revenue).  It sounded easy to think.  Twitter had 250M+ daily active users but only 0.2% ended up paid for twitter blue.   I’m guessing he expected around 10% to pay.   That was a flop. 

2. That already verified celebrity will have no issues with paying a small fee to keep their verification.   The early stigma around paying for a verification; which totally devalues the whole idea initially made a lot of celebrities decide not to pay.   To fix this, Elon started dashing then for free.    He did a lot of beta testing on this sha.  Well done to him.

One last mistake he didn’t see coming was also assuming all companies will gladly pay for the gold checkmark of about $1k/ month.  That flopped also.  

Now from the beginning, twitter ads haven’t had the best returns as the platform allows users to even ignore or cancel seeing ads.   So impression for advertisers kept dropping.   To fix this, I believe Elon started dropping ads in comment section to increase impressions and double up on advertiser’s money.    That was when the idea hit him, people have been funnelling their contents from twitter to other platforms like YouTube, twitch etc.    People post their contents overthere but use their twitter account to send their followers to go and watch it on YouTube.   

YouTube and twitch + others already share ads revenue with content creators, so what’s stopping twitter from doing it????

Instead of just using my twitter to directly traffic to YouTube so people can watch your videos and you make money from YouTube, how about you just post that video here and I’ll also pay you more than what YouTube is paying you????

Advertisers wins = more impressions.  
Creators wins = more revenue.  
Twitter wins = more advertising budgets and new advertisers.   

In business,  this is an art called  flexibility.  Will it backfire? Maybe, is it working right now? Maybe. Time will tell and so will our Stripe account.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1688964825785753600","false","true","false","true",,,,,,,,,,,,"148","1692936003922165800","1688855795994173440","2023-08-08T10:12:53.000Z","8400","But how is Elon Musk making money from this tho??

"1685153981117456386","2023-07-29T05:03:12.000Z","2070","The removal of the petrol subsidy by President Bola Tinubu is taking a toll on European refiners according to Reuters.
“the black market for smuggled subsidised Nigerian fuel in Togo and neighbouring Benin and Cameroon has collapsed, further reducing demand for shipments via Nigeria. There is no reliable data on how much fuel was smuggled out of Nigeria under the subsidy regime, but a comparison of estimates from official and independent sources indicate more than a third of petrol could have left state oil firm NNPC’s depots every day to be sold illegally abroad.
Without the subsidy, the financial incentive for smuggling disappears.”
Corroborating the report on the effect of the subsidy removal on European refineries, Refinitiv lead oil analyst, Raj Rajendran, said, “The key point is demand from West Africa is drying up.
“Imports, however, are increasingly unaffordable as Nigeria’s naira has weakened to record lows since the central bank removed currency restrictions in June. At the same time, inflation is near two-decade highs.
The huge, much-delayed Dangote refinery was designed to address the domestic supply shortfall, but full 650,000 barrel per day production is unlikely before the second quarter of 2025, CITAC estimates.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1685153981117456386","false","false","false","true",,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F2Lem5wXEAAdfIj.jpg","photo",,,,,,,,,"35",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"184",,"394","https://twitter.com/Imranmuhdz/with_replies",,"https://twitter.com/Imranmuhdz/status/1685153981117456386",,,,,,,"1518252654346051587",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Imranmuhdz","363087"

The Acting National Chairman, Ambassador Umar Damagum, said that consultation was already in progress on the Wike issue.
“We are already consulting with the PDP Governors Forum on the matter and the National Working Committee (NWC) will be meeting on Monday to take a definite position on it, There is no lull in the PDP like you said, just because you have not seen us moving to the streets. Consultations are ongoing with key stakeholders.
Among those we are consulting with are state chairmen, the PDP Governors Forum, past National Chairmen and a select group of PDP elders. We are also meeting with the leadership of the PDP Youth organ next week. So we have not been idle as some people might think.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1685150950539812864","false","false","false","true",,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F2Lb2r-W0AEJx5x.jpg","photo",,,,,,,,,"56",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"304",,"215","https://twitter.com/Imranmuhdz/with_replies",,"https://twitter.com/Imranmuhdz/status/1685150950539812864",,,,,,,"1518252654346051587",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Imranmuhdz","424022"

So far, in 2023, we have written 10 checks, 5 new partnerships (pre-seed & seed), and 5 follow on’s. 

This week we closed our 1st series A investment; in a company we partnered with early from discovery (pre-seed) through a pivot into their seed. Lots of work here, including raising debt, hunkering down, and doing the hard work along with the founders, and now this A. This signals an important milestone that cements our evolved strategy of long-term partnerships with category leaders across the continent. 

This week, we also held an IC, board, and team retreat.

"1686347049816432640","2023-08-01T12:04:02.000Z","9111","I had a conversation with this young multimillionaire who’s a top guy in the influencing and marketing space just last week. He’s worked for over 300 brands with over 15years of practice. And he said something, I send out proposals to more than 20 brands daily, 20 x 365 days = 7,300.

That’s at least 7,300 proposals yearly, but he’s yet to work with 500 brands still. It’s just 300+ brands so far, even though some of the proposals are reminders to brands who once rejected his offers, while some he got no response from them at all. 

And he’s been consistent with sending out proposals for over 10 years now. 

He said “people celebrate me a lot because of the results they see, but don’t know that I get rejected a lot by these brands. The only good thing is, even one brand can change your life and finances, now imagine 300+, that’s a lot of money. The results for those I’ve worked with is enough to get me a good life. So, the more proposals I send out, the higher my chances of getting interested brands that are ready to spend life changing money to get my services.”

He said he wakes up every morning reminding himself that there’s no harm in trying. He then checks through his email to see if he got responses yet, mark the ones that are being successful or promising, check up on old existing clients too, and that’s how he made a living for himself. 

It doesn’t matter how many times you get rejected, just one win can change your whole life, now imagine having two wins, 10 wins, 100 wins, 300 wins (in his own profession; it’s 300 brands), that’s more than enough to change your life forever. 

Don’t stop trying, don’t stop putting yourself out there, don’t stop reaching out, don’t stop sending that mail (the proposal, your CV), don’t let rejection get the best part of you. Understand life is a number game, you win some, you lose some with hopes that the wins outweigh the losses.
